**Definitions**

- A Neural Machine Translation service that provides fluent translation with higher accuracy than traditional statistical and rule-based translation models.
- Powered by deep learning models that deliver fast, accurate, and affordable translation between supported languages.
- Supports batch translation, real-time, and on-demand translations.


**Common Use Cases**

- Language localization

### **Concepts**

- Amazon Translate uses a Translation Model that consists of two (2) components:
    - Encoder
        - Read a source text one word at a time.
        - Creates a semantic representation of each word.
    - Decoder
        - Uses the constructed semantic representation of the encoded text and translates it to the target language one word at a time.
        - The decoder also uses a method called the Attention mechanism to translate obscure words or phrases correctly.
- When Automatic Language Detection is enabled, Amazon Translate uses Amazon Comprehend on the backend to automatically detect the language used in the source text.
