**Definitions**

AWS Database Migration Service
Trusted by customers globally to securely migrate 800,000+ databases with minimal downtime

Discover, assess, convert, and migrate your database and analytics workloads to AWS with automated migration.

Maintain high availability and minimal downtime during the migration process with Multi-AZ and ongoing data replication and monitoring.

Supports homogeneous and heterogeneous database migrations from Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, and other databases.

Migrate a terabyte-sized database at a low cost, paying only for the compute resources and additional log storage used during the migration process.

**How it works**

AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a managed migration and replication service that helps move your database and analytics workloads to AWS quickly, securely, and with minimal downtime and zero data loss. AWS DMS supports migration between 20-plus database and analytics engines, such as Oracle to Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition, MySQL to Amazon Relational Database (RDS) for MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition, MongoDB to Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility), Oracle to Amazon Redshift, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).

### How it works

**Transfer data between on premises and AWS**

AWS DataSync is a secure, online service that automates and accelerates moving data between on premises and AWS Storage services. DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS) shares, Server Message Block (SMB) shares, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS), self-managed object storage, AWS Snowcone, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems, Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, Amazon FSz for OpenZFS file systems, and Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems.

**Transfer data between AWS storage services**

AWS DataSync is also used to transfer data between AWS Storage services so you can replicate, archive, or share application data easily.

**Transfer data between AWS and other locations**

AWS DataSync supports moving data between other public clouds and AWS Storage services.

## <a id="section-08" ></a> **8 - AWS Application Migration Service (CloudEndure Migration)**


![AWS Application Migration Service](../images/Architecture-Service-Icons_07312022/Arch_Migration-Transfer/64/Arch_AWS-Application-Migration-Service_64.svg)


**Definitions**

CloudEndure Migration and CloudEndure Disaster Recovery, services offered by AWS, now allow you to migrate, replicate, and recover applications from any source directly into AWS Outposts or between AWS Outposts devices, leading to lower latencies, better performance, and reduced costs. Previously, replicated data had to be transferred to and stored in a public AWS Region before being copied into EBS volumes on the AWS Outposts device. This caused increased cutover and recovery times, as well as data residency issues.

CloudEndure services’ newly launched support of EBS Local Snapshots on AWS Outposts is intended for users who need to run their applications on premises due to low latency, local data processing, or data residency policies that require data and backups to be stored in a specific country, state, or municipality for regulatory, contractual, or information security reasons.

Now that CloudEndure Migration supports replication to and from AWS Outposts, and between AWS Outposts, you can quickly lift and shift your applications without compatibility issues into an AWS native format while continuing to operate in your data center.

With CloudEndure Disaster Recovery now supporting AWS Outposts, you can increase the resilience of your on-premise applications by replicating into and failing over to an AWS Outposts device. You no longer need to failover to a public AWS Region. In addition, if you already have applications running on an AWS Outposts device, you can replicate and failover between two AWS Outposts devices.

This new feature is supported in all AWS Regions in which AWS Outposts and CloudEndure services are available.

To learn more, visit the CloudEndure Migration or CloudEndure Disaster Recovery product pages. For technical information on how to use CloudEndure services with AWS Outposts, visit this CloudEndure documentation page.
