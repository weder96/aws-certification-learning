## <a id="section-01"> </a> **1 - Amazon Inspector**
![Amazon Inspector](../images/Architecture09172021/Arch_Security-Identity-Compliance/48/Arch_Amazon-Inspector_48.png)

The AWS Cloud allows for a shared responsibility model.

AWS manages cloud security; you are responsible for security in the cloud.

You retain control of the security you choose to implement to protect your own content, platform, applications, systems and networks just as you would in an on-premises data center.

**Amazon Security Benefits**
- Keep your data safe – AWS infrastructure implements strong protections to help.
- Protect your privacy – All data is stored in highly secure AWS data centers.
- Meet compliance requirements – AWS manages dozens of compliance programs across its infrastructure. This means that your compliance segments have already been completed.
- Save money – reduce costs by using AWS data centers. Maintain the highest standard of security without having to manage your own facilities.
- Scale quickly – Security scales using the AWS Cloud. No matter the size of your business, the AWS infrastructure is designed to keep your data safe.

**Compliance**
AWS Cloud Compliance lets you understand the robust controls in place at AWS to keep your data safe and secure in the cloud.

As systems are built on top of the AWS Cloud infrastructure, compliance responsibilities will be shared.

Compliance programs include:
- Certifications / attestations.
- Laws, regulations and privacy.
- Alignments/frames.

## <a id="section-05"> </a> **5 - AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)**

![Amazon Artifact](../images/Architecture09172021/Arch_Security-Identity-Compliance/48/Arch_AWS-Key-Management-Service_48.png)

AWS Key Management Service gives you centralized control over the encryption keys used to protect your data.

You can create, import, toggle, disable, delete, set usage policies, and audit the usage of encryption keys used to encrypt your data.

The AWS Key Management Service is integrated with most other AWS services, making it easy to encrypt the data stored in those services with encryption keys that you control.

AWS KMS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, which gives you the ability to audit who used which keys, on which resources, and when.

AWS KMS allows developers to easily encrypt data, either through one-click encryption in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS SDK to easily add encryption to application code.

### **KMS – Customer Master Key (CMK) Types**

- **Symmetric (AES-256 keys)**
     - First offering of KMS, single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt
     - AWS services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs
     - Necessary for envelope encryption
     - You never get access to the Key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)


- **Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)**
     - Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair
     - Used for Encrypt/Decrypt, or Sign/Verify operations
     - The public key is downloadable, but you can’t access the Private Key unencrypted
     - Use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who can’t call the KMS API

- **Able to fully manage the keys & policies:**
     - Create
     - Rotation policies
     - Disable
     - Enable


- **Able to audit key usage (using CloudTrail)**
- **Three types of Customer Master Keys (CMK):**
     - AWS Managed Service Default CMK: free
     - User Keys created in KMS: $1 / month
     - User Keys imported (must be 256-bit symmetric key): $1 / month


- **pay for API call to KMS ($0.03 / 10000 calls)**

## <a id="section-14"></a> **14 - AWS Secrets Manager**

![Amazon Artifact](../images/Architecture09172021/Arch_Security-Identity-Compliance/64/Arch_AWS-Secrets-Manager_64.svg)

**Definitions**

- A **secret management service** that enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle.

#### **Features**

- **AWS Secrets Manager** encrypts secrets at rest using encryption keys that you own and store in AWS Key Management Service [customer managed keys]. When you retrieve a secret, Secrets Manager decrypts the secret and transmits it securely over TLS to your local environment.

You can rotate secrets on a schedule or on demand by using the Secrets Manager console, AWS SDK, or AWS CLI.

Secrets Manager natively supports rotating credentials for databases hosted on Amazon RDS and Amazon DocumentDB and clusters hosted on Amazon Redshift.
You can extend Secrets Manager to rotate other secrets, such as credentials for Oracle databases hosted on EC2 or OAuth refresh tokens, by using custom AWS 

**Lambda functions.**

A secret consists of a set of credentials (user name and password), and the connection details used to access a secured service.

**Security**

- By default, Secrets Manager does not write or cache the secret to persistent storage.
- By default, Secrets Manager only accepts requests from hosts that use the open standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Perfect Forward Secrecy.
- You can control access to the secret using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. 
- You can tag secrets individually and apply tag-based access controls.
- You can configure VPC endpoints to keep traffic between your VPC and Secrets Manager within the AWS network.
- Secrets Manager does not immediately delete secrets. Instead, Secrets Manager immediately makes the secrets inaccessible and scheduled for deletion after a recovery window of a minimum of seven days. Until the recovery window ends, you can recover a secret you previously deleted. 
- By using the CLI, you can delete a secret without a recovery window.
Compliance

Secrets Manager is HIPAA, PCI DSS and ISO, SOC, FedRAMP, DoD SRG, IRAP, and OSPAR compliant.

**Pricing**
- You pay based on the number of secrets stored and API calls made per month.

**Definitions**

Shield Tiers and Features

**Standard**

- All AWS customers benefit from the automatic protections of Shield Standard.
- Shield Standard provides always-on network flow monitoring which inspects incoming traffic to AWS and detect malicious traffic in real-time.
- Uses several techniques like deterministic packet filtering, and priority based traffic shaping to automatically mitigate attacks without impact to your applications.
- When you use Shield Standard with CloudFront and Route 53, you receive comprehensive availability protection against all known infrastructure attacks.
- You can also view all the events detected and mitigated by AWS Shield in your account.

**Advanced**

- Shield Advanced provides enhanced detection, inspecting network flows and also monitoring application layer traffic to your Elastic IP address, Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, or Route 53 resources.
- It handles the majority of DDoS protection and mitigation responsibilities for layer 3, layer 4, and layer 7 attacks.
- You have 24×7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team. To contact the DDoS Response Team, customers will need the  Enterprise or Business Support levels of AWS Premium Support.
- It automatically provides additional mitigation capacity to protect against larger DDoS attacks. The DDoS Response Team also applies manual mitigations for more complex and sophisticated DDoS attacks.
- It gives you complete visibility into DDoS attacks with near real-time notification via CloudWatch and detailed diagnostics on the “AWS WAF and AWS Shield” Management Console.
- Shield Advanced comes with “DDoS cost protection”, a safeguard from scaling charges as a result of a DDoS attack that cause usage spikes on your AWS services. It does so by providing service credits for charges due to usage spikes.
- It is available globally on all CloudFront and Route 53 edge locations. 
- With Shield Advanced you will be able to see the history of all incidents in the trailing 13 months.

### **Pricing**
- Shield Standard provides protection at no additional charge.

## <a id="section-27"></a> **27 - Encryption and Unencrypted**

AWS enables covered entities and their business associates subject to the U.S. Health Insurance 

Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to use the secure AWS environment to process, maintain, and store protected health information.

AWS also provides open-source cryptographic libraries:

AWS [libcrypto (AWS-LC)](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lc) provides a general-purpose cryptographic library maintained by the AWS Cryptography team for AWS and their customers. It іs based on code from the Google BoringSSL project and the OpenSSL project. AWS-LC contains portable C implementations of algorithms needed for TLS and common applications. For performance critical algorithms, optimized assembly versions are included for x86 and ARM.

[s2n-tls](https://github.com/aws/s2n-tls) provides an implementation of the TLS/SSL protocols that is designed to be simple, small, fast, and with security as a priority.

Using Encryption Services:
### **Amazon EFS – Elastic File System**
- Encryption at rest using KMS
- Compatible with Linux based AMI (not Windows)

### **EBS Encryption**
- Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you have nothing todo)
- ncryption has a minimal impact on latency
- EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)

### **RDS Security - Encryption** 
- At rest encryption
     - Possibility to encrypt the master & read replicas with AWS KMS - AES-256 encryption
     - Encryption has to be defined at launch time
     - If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
     - Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) available for Oracle and SQL Server
- In-flight encryption
     - SSL certificates to encrypt data to RDS in flight
     - Provide SSL options with trust certificate when connecting to database
     - To enforce SSL:
          - PostgreSQL: rds.force_ssl=1 in the AWS RDS Console (Parameter Groups)
          - MySQL: Within the DB:
               GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;

### **Aurora Security**
- Similar to RDS because uses the same engines
- Encryption at rest using KMS
- Automated backups, snapshots and replicas are also encrypted
- Encryption in flight using SSL (same process as MySQL or Postgres)
- Possibility to authenticate using IAM token (same method as RDS)
- You are responsible for protecting the instance with security groups
- You can’t SSH

### **S3 Security**
- There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3
     - SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
     - SSE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
     - SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
     - Client Side Encryption

- It’s important to understand which ones are adapted to which situation for the exam

1. **SSE-S3**
- SSE-S3: encryption using keys handled & managed by Amazon S3
- Object is encrypted server side
- AES-256 encryption type
- Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"

![sse_s3](../images/extra/sse_s3.png)

2. **SSE-KMS**
- SSE-KMS: encryption using keys handled & managed by KMS
- KMS Advantages: user control + audit trail
- Object is encrypted server side
- Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption": ”aws:kms"

![sse_kms](../images/extra/sse_kms.png)

3. **SSE-C**
- SSE-C: server-side encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS
- Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key you provide
- HTTPS must be used
- Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made


![sse_c](../images/extra/sse_c.png)

4. **Client Side Encryption**
- Client library such as the Amazon S3 Encryption Client
- Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3
- Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3
- Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle


![client_side_encription](../images/extra/client_side_encription.png)

### **S3 – KMS Limitation**
- If you use SSE-KMS, you may be impacted by the KMS limits
- When you upload, it calls the GenerateDataKey KMS API
- When you download, it calls the Decrypt KMS API
- Count towards the KMS quota per second (5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region)
- You can request a quota increase using the Service Quotas Console

![limitation_kms](../images/extra/kms_li%2Citation.png)


### **Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)**

- Amazon S3 exposes:
     - HTTP endpoint: non encrypted
     - HTTPS endpoint: encryption in flight

- You’re free to use the endpoint you want, but HTTPS is recommended
- Most clients would use the HTTPS endpoint by default

- HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C
- Encryption in flight is also called SSL / TLS


### **Amazon SQS - Security**
- In-flight encryption using HTTPS API
- At-rest encryption using KMS keys
- Client-side encryption if the client wants to perform encryption/decryption itself

### **Amazon SNS – Security**
- In-flight encryption using HTTPS API
- At-rest encryption using KMS keys
- Client-side encryption if the client wants to perform encryption/decryption itself

### **Amazon OpenSearch Service**
- Security through Cognito & IAM, KMS encryption, SSL & VPC


### **Direct Connect – Encryption**
- Data in transit is not encrypted but is private

### **Redis AUTH**
- Support SSL in flight encryption

### **CloudFront – Field Level Encryption**
- Sensitive information encrypted at the edge close to user
- Uses asymmetric encryption

### **Neptune**
- Support for KMS encryption at rest + HTTPS

## <a id="section-28"></a> **28 - Security Groups**

Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS

• They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.

![securityGroup](../images/securityGroup.png)

• Security groups only contain rules

• Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

### Deeper Dive

Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances
- They regulate:
     - Access to Ports
     - Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6
     - Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
     - Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

![](../images/firewallSecurityGroup.png)

### Diagram
![](../images/diagramaSecurityGroup.png)

### Good to Know

Can be attached to multiple instances

Locked down to a region / VPC combination

Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it

It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access

If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue

If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application error or it’s not launched

All inbound traffic is blocked by default

All outbound traffic is authorise

### Referencing other security groups

![reference Security Group](../images/referenceSecurityGroup.png)

### Classic ports to Know

- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
- 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
- 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
- 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance


### Summary Tables

![](../images/summarySecurityGroup.png)

### Which Lectures to watch

Mac / Linux:
- SSH on Mac/Linux lecture

Windows:
- Putty Lecture
- If Windows 10: SSH on Windows 10 lecture

All:
- EC2 Instance Connect lecture

### SSH troubleshooting

- Students have the most problems with SSH
- If things don’t work...

1. Re-watch the lecture. You may have missed something
2. Read the troubleshooting guide
3. Try EC2 Instance Connect

- If one method works (SSH, Putty or EC2 Instance Connect) you’re good
- If no method works, that’s okay, the course won’t use SSH much

### How to SSH into your EC2 Instance Linux / Mac OS X

- We’ll learn how to SSH into your EC2 instance using Linux / Mac
-  SSH is one of the most important function. It allows you to control a remote machine, all using the command line.

![](../images/ec2SSH.png)

- We will see how we can configure **OpenSSH ~/.ssh/config** to facilitate the SSH into our EC2 instances

### How to SSH into your EC2 Instance Windows

- We’ll learn how to SSH into your EC2 instance using Linux / Mac
-  SSH is one of the most important function. It allows you to control a remote machine, all using the command line.

![](../images/ec2SSH.png)

• We will configure all the required parameters necessary for doing SSH
on Windows using the free tool **Putty**.

### EC2 Instance Connect

- Connect to your EC2 instance within your browser
- No need to use your key file that was downloaded
- The “magic” is that a temporary key is uploaded onto EC2 by AWS
- Works only out-of-the-box with Amazon Linux 2
- Need to make sure the **port 22 is still opened!**

## <a id="section-99"></a> **99 - How do I report abuse of AWS resources?**
### **I suspect that AWS resources are used for abusive or illegal purposes. How do I let AWS know?** [here](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/report-aws-abuse/)

**Resolution:**
The AWS Trust & Safety team can assist you when AWS resources are used to engage in the following types of abusive behavior:
- **Spam:** You are receiving unwanted emails from an AWS-owned IP address, or AWS resources are used to spam websites or forums.
- **Port scanning:** Your logs show that one or more AWS-owned IP addresses are sending packets to multiple ports on your server. You also believe this is an attempt to discover unsecured ports.
- **Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks:** Your logs show that one or more AWS-owned IP addresses are used to flood ports on your resources with packets. You also believe that this is an attempt to overwhelm or crash your server or the software running on your server.
- **Intrusion attempts:** Your logs show that one or more AWS-owned IP addresses are used to attempt to log in to your resources.
- **Hosting prohibited content:** You have evidence that AWS resources are used to host or distribute prohibited content, such as illegal content or copyrighted content without the consent of the copyright holder.
- **Distributing malware:** You have evidence that AWS resources are used to distribute software that was knowingly created to compromise or cause harm to computers or machines that it's installed on.

If you suspect that AWS resources are used for abusive purposes, contact the AWS Trust & Safety team using the Report Amazon AWS abuse form, or by contacting abuse@amazonaws.com. Provide all the necessary information, including logs in plaintext, email headers, and so on, when you submit your request.

The AWS Trust & Safety team will use the information that you provide in this form to investigate and attempt to resolve the incident you have reported. We might share your information, if it is necessary for the investigation of your report.

Note: AWS Support can't assist with reports of abuse or questions about notifications from the AWS Trust & Safety team. If you have questions for the AWS Trust & Safety team, reply directly to their email.
