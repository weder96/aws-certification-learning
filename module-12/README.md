## <a id="section-1" > </a> **1 - Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)**

![SNS](../images/Architecture09172021/Arch_App-Integration/Arch_64/Arch_Amazon-Simple-Notification-Service_64.svg)

**Definition**

### What if you want to send one message to many receivers?

- The “event producer” only sends message to one SNS topic
- As many “event receivers” (subscriptions) as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications
- Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages (note: new feature to filter messages)
- Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic
- 100,000 topics limit

### SNS integrates with a lot of AWS services

- CloudWatch Alarms 
- AWS Budgets
- Lambda
- Auto Scaling Group (Notifications)
- S3 Bucket (Events)
- DynamoDB
- CloudFormation (State Changes)
- AWS DMS (New Replic)
- RDS Events

### Amazon SNS – How to publish

- **Topic Publish (using the SDK)**
    - Create a topic
    - Create a subscription (or many)
    - Publish to the topic

- **Direct Publish (for mobile apps SDK)**
    - Create a platform application
    - Create a platform endpoint
    - Publish to the platform endpoint
    - Works with Google GCM, Apple APNS, Amazon ADM...

### Amazon SNS – Security

- **Encryption:**
    - In-flight encryption using HTTPS API
    - At-rest encryption using KMS keys
    - Client-side encryption if the client wants to perform encryption/decryption itself

- Access Controls: IAM policies to regulate access to the SNS API

- SNS Access Policies (similar to S3 bucket policies)
    - Useful for cross-account access to SNS topics
    - Useful for allowing other services ( S3...) to write to an SNS topic

### SNS + SQS: Fan Out

- Push once in SNS, receive in all SQS queues that are subscribers
- Fully decoupled, no data loss
- SQS allows for: data persistence, delayed processing and retries of work
- Ability to add more SQS subscribers over time
- Make sure your SQS queue access policy allows for SNS to write

### Application: S3 Events to multiple queues

- For the same combination of: event type (e.g. object create) and prefix (e.g. images/) you can only have one S3 Event rule
- If you want to send the same S3 event to many SQS queues, use fan-out

### Application: SNS to Amazon S3 through

- Kinesis Data Firehose


### Amazon SNS – FIFO Topic

- FIFO = First In First Out (ordering of messages in the topic)
- Similar features as SQS FIFO:
    - Ordering by Message Group ID (all messages in the same group are ordered)
    - Deduplication using a Deduplication ID or Content Based Deduplication
- Can only have SQS FIFO queues as subscribers
- Limited throughput (same throughput as SQS FIFO)

### SNS FIFO + SQS FIFO: Fan Out
- In case you need fan out + ordering + deduplication

### SNS – Message Filtering

- JSON policy used to filter messages sent to SNS topic’s subscriptions
- If a subscription doesn’t have a filter policy, it receives every message

## <a id="section-3" > </a> **3 - Amazon-MQ**

![SNS](../images/Architecture09172021/Arch_App-Integration/Arch_64/Arch_Amazon-MQ_64.svg)

**Definition**
- SQS, SNS are “cloud-native” services: proprietary protocols from AWS
- Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
- When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
- Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for
- Amazon MQ doesn’t “scale” as much as SQS / SNS
- Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in Multi-AZ with failover
- Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)

AWS offering for a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ. Message brokers allow different software systems–often using different programming languages, and on different platforms–to communicate and exchange information.
Amazon MQ also supports RabbitMQ, a popular open-source message broker. Migrate your existing RabbitMQ message brokers to AWS without having to rewrite code.


### **Features**

Amazon MQ uses industry-standard APIs and protocols for messaging, including Java Message Service (JMS), .NET Message Service (NMS), AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, OpenWire, and WebSocket.
Amazon MQ manages administrative tasks such as hardware provisioning, broker setup, software upgrades, and failure detection and recovery.
Amazon MQ stores your messages redundantly across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
Amazon MQ supports both single-instance brokers, suitable for evaluation and testing, and active/standby brokers for high availability in production. In the event of a failure of the broker, or even a full AZ outage, Amazon MQ automatically fails over to the standby broker.

**Definition**

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.

1 million API calls received free

per month for 12 months with the AWS Free Tier

**Definition**

### What Is Amazon EventBridge?

EventBridge is a serverless service that uses events to connect application components together, making it easier for you to build scalable event-driven applications. 
Use it to route events from sources such as home-grown applications, AWS services, and third- party software to consumer applications across your organization. EventBridge provides a simple and consistent way to ingest, filter, transform, and deliver events so you can build new applications quickly.

EventBridge event buses are well suited for many-to-many routing of events between eventdriven services. 

EventBridge Pipes (p. 90) is intended for point-to-point integrations between

### **Amazon EventBridge Pipes**

Amazon EventBridge Pipes connects sources to targets. It reduces the need for specialized knowledge and integration code when developing event driven architectures, fostering consistency across your company’s applications. To set up a pipe, you choose the source, add optional filtering, define optional enrichment, and choose the target for the event data.

EventBridge Pipes could be used to create an ecommerce system. Imagine that you have an API that contains customer metadata, such as shipping addresses. The source might be an Amazon SQS order received message. 

The pipe then sends that data to an Amazon API Gateway API enrichment that returns the customer information for that order. Final
